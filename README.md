This is me playing around with the LOVE2D (https://love2d.org/) game engine.

Demo at https://youtu.be/xEIKPqjgOlg

To get this to run you'll need the anim8 Lua library from kikito https://github.com/kikito/anim8

Put anim8.lua alongside main.lua.

You'll also need a copy of the SevenKingdoms graphics files from http://opengameart.org/content/seven-kingdoms.

Unzip them as SevenKingdoms_graphics alongsize main.lua.

I think because I use the SevenKingdoms graphics and those are GPL, all the rest of this stuff is GPL covered by GPL as well.

I run this in ZeroBrainStudio (https://github.com/pkulchenko/ZeroBraneStudio).
